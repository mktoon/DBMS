Create a README.txt file and explain how to run your code.

This is phase 3 of the project.
 I wrote the program in java, using Eclipse IDE. 
 TO run the program: Click on the compile and run on the menu bar, 
 the console will display the command line based interactive asking user to choose 
 from options on what to perform. Everytime a user selects an option, the program is executed to perform the task, 
 ie retrieve data, delete, insert and calculate the average of a column in a table.

 I have submitted a video of how i run the program and had it perform the different functionalities along side with the code written in java
